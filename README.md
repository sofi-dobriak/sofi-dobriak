Hi 👋 My name is Sofi
=============================

Studying to become a FullStack developer
----------------------------------------

Formerly a photo editor, I chose IT as a career path because of my desire to develop. My goal is to create simple and effective solutions that solve real user problems. I am actively working on my favorite projects based on feedback and requests from real users, and I get a lot of pleasure from it.
