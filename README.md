**Hi there, I'm Sofi**

- 👀 I’m interested in Front-End development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and CSS technologies, and I'm also starting to learn JS and frameworks based on it for work
- ⚡ Fun fact: I need to remind myself that rest is important
- ✍️ Important: For each repositories I wrote a short description of the project using the chronology from the previous repositories in the following ones
- 🤝 I invite you to enjoy this journey of learning a new profession
